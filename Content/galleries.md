Wall Murals: Wall murals are one of my favorite forms of art.  I particularly enjoy doing them for children simply for the look on their face when they walk into their bedroom and see Calvin and Hobbes or Strawberry Shortcake on their wall.

Drawings: When I first got interested in art, I began with just a mechanical pencil and notebook paper.  As I've expanded my experience with other art mediums, I have still always come back to loving the simplicity of drawing.

Paintings: When I first started painting, I didn't like the medium, but I quickly grew to love it.  It is now one of my favorite mediums.
