This website is of art I've done between the ages of twelve and twenty-one.  I still have these pieces and enjoy selling them and recreating similar pieces for people at a reasanable price.

If you are interesting in purchasing something or commisioning me to make a piece of your own, please email me at [marissa@reckerfamily.com](mailto:marissa@reckerfamily.com).

Thanks for checking my website out!
